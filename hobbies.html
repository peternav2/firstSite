      This photo above shows me training in one of my favorite hobbies / sports; Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.
      It is a sport with few rules.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>No Hitting of Any Kind (punching, kicking, etc...)</li>
        <li>No Dirty Tactics Like Hair Pulling or Eye Gouging</li>
      </ol>
      <p class="paragraph">
      With this in mind. The goal of the sport is to make the person submit by tapping out or verbally saying "tap".
      You can do this by any means possible including but not limited to; arm bars (attacks meant to injure the arm), chokeholds, leg locks (attacks meant to injure the legs), etc...
      While this sounds dangerous at first (and most definitely can be), with the proper training group consisting of those with good hearts, you will be able to practice
      real life self defense in a situation where you can just tap out once you are in too comprimised of a position, immediatly reset and have another go. As opposed to
      some sports like boxing where damage is almost inevitable due to the high contact nature of the sport, even if you go use a large amount of your power against your training partner in bjj, injury is avoidable
      by simply tapping out and restarting before any arm locks or chokeholds become to dangerous. In boxing you can not train with another idividual at maximum strength or else you risk serious
      brain damage, whereas in jiu-jitsu, with the right group of people hard sparring can be a daily occurrence.
